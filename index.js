//1.
//Flatten

/* Flatten a given array, eliminating nested and empty arrays. 
Do not alter it; return a new one retaining order. For [1,[2,3],4,[]] return [1,2,3,4].

Second: work ‘in-place’ in the given array (do not create another). 
Alter order if needed. Ex.: [1,[2,3],4,[]] could become [1,3,4,2].

Third: make your algorithm both in-place and stable. 
Do you need a return value? */
